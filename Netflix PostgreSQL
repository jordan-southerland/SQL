This project utilized data from the Netflix database stored at http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/7dae0

#Using the PostgreSQL dialect, write a join to select a few columns from both tables at the same time.
SELECT nt.show_id, title, director, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info" AS nt
JOIN "netflix_people" AS np
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id;

#How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(show_id)
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

#List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#Who was the Director for the movie The Starling?
SELECT director
FROM "netflix_people" np
JOIN "netflix_titles_info" nti
ON np.show_id=nti.show_id
WHERE nti.title='The Starling';

#What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
